1. Start the program
2. Set SI source index register to point to memory address 3000.
2. Set DI destination index register to point to memory address 4000.
4. Load the value at the memory address pointed by SI into register AX.
5. Increment the SI register by 2, assuming it’s pointing to a word (2 bytes) in memory.
6. Load the value at the updated memory address (now 3002 after incrementing SI by 2) into register BX. This value will act as the divisor in the division operation.
7. Divide the value in AX (dividend) by the value in BX (divisor). After this division:
•	The quotient of the division is stored in AX.
•	The remainder of the division is stored in DX.
8.  Store the quotient (from AX) at the memory address pointed to by DI.
9.Increment the DI register by 2 to point to the next memory location, preparing to store the remainder.
10. Store the remainder (from DX) at the updated memory address pointed to by DI 
11. Halt the program execution with the HLT instruction.
