1.Start the program
2. Set the source index register SI to point to memory address 3000.
3. Set the destination index register DI to point to memory address 4000.
4.Load the value at the memory address pointed by SI into the AX register.
5.Increment SI by 2 (assuming SI points to word or 2 bytes in memory)
6.Load the value at the updated memory address pointed by SI into the BX register
7.Multiply the value in AX by the value in BX, storing the result in AX (product) and DX (high-order bits of the product)
8.Store the value in AX at the memory address pointed by DI.
9.Increment DI by 2 (assuming DI points to a word or 2 bytes in memory)
10. Store the value in DX at the updated memory address pointed by DI.
11. Halt the program
