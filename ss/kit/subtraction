1.Start the program
2.Set SI register to the memory address 3000
3.Set DI register to the memory address 4000
4.Load the value at the memory address stored in SI into the AX register.
5.Increment the SI register by 2 (assuming SI points to a word or 2 bytes)
6.Load the value at the updated memory address stored in SI into the BX register.
7.Compare the values in AX and BX.
	1. If AX is less than BX, jump to memory address 2017.
	2. Otherwise, continue to the next instruction.
8. Subtract BX from AX.
9.Store the value 0000 at the memory address stored in DI.
10.Jump to memory address 2022.
11.If AX was less than BX:
	1.Move the value in AX to the CX register
	2. Move the value in BX to AX.
	3. Move the value in CX to BX.
	4. Subtract BX from AX.
	5. Store the value 0001 at the memory address stored in DI.
12. Increment the DI register by 1.
13. Store the value in AX at the memory address stored in DI.
14. Halt the program
