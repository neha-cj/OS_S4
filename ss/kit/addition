1.Start the program
2.Set the source Index (SI) register to point to memory address 3000.
3.Set the Destination Index (DI) register to point to memory address 4000.
4.Load the value stored at the memory address pointed to by SI into the AX register.
5.Increment the SI register by 2 bytes (assuming SI is pointing to a word or 2 bytes)
6.Load the value stored at the updated memory address pointed to by SI into the BX register.
7.Add the values stored in AX and BX registers and store the result in the AX register.
8.Check if there was no carry generated during the addition
	1.If no carry occurred, store the value 0001 at the memory address pointed to by DI.
	2. If a carry occurred, store the value 0000 at the memory address pointed to by DI.
9.Increment the DI register to point to the next memory address.
10. Store the contents of the AX register at the memory address pointed to by DI.
11. Halt the execution of the program
